> **Objectomaly** is a post-hoc, training-free refinement framework for Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation. It improves structural consistency and boundary precision by incorporating object-level priors through a three-stage pipeline: CAS, OASC, and MBP.

## :ë‡Œ: Overview
Semantic segmentation models often struggle with unknown or unexpected objects, especially in safety-critical environments like autonomous driving. Existing OoD methods face challenges like:
- :x: Imprecise boundaries
- :x: Inconsistent scores within object regions
- :x: False positives from background textures
## Installation

See [installation instructions](INSTALL.md).
